My Recommended Implementation Strategy
Phase 1: Foundation & Risk Assessment (Days 1-2)
1. Database Schema Strategy
Create new account tables without breaking existing single-user functionality
Add account_id columns with nullable constraints initially
Implement migration strategy that preserves all existing user data
Create default accounts for existing users automatically
2. Backwards Compatibility Approach
Keep existing API endpoints functional during transition
Add new account-aware endpoints alongside old ones
Implement feature flags to gradually roll out multi-user features
Phase 2: Core Multi-User Infrastructure (Days 3-5)
3. Account Management Backend
Implement account creation and user association
Build invitation system with email integration
Add role-based middleware for API protection
Create usage tracking and limits system
4. Authentication Enhancement
Extend Firebase auth to include account context
Update JWT tokens with account_id and role information
Implement secure account switching mechanism
Phase 3: Frontend Integration (Days 6-8)
5. UI/UX Implementation
Create account dashboard for super admins
Implement role-based component rendering
Add account switching interface
Update color scheme consistently across all components
6. User Experience Flow
Build invitation acceptance workflow
Create user onboarding for invited users
Implement account selection for multi-account users
Phase 4: Testing & Optimization (Days 9-10)
7. Comprehensive Testing
End-to-end testing of invitation flows
Load testing with 30 concurrent users
Security audit of role-based permissions
Performance optimization for database connections
Critical Considerations for 15-30 Test Users
Database Scaling:
Current 10-connection limit needs immediate attention
Recommend upgrading to at least 25-50 connections
Implement connection pooling optimization
Risk Mitigation:
Deploy in stages with feature flags
Maintain rollback capability at each phase
Test thoroughly with existing data before each migration
Launch Strategy:
Start with 5-10 test users for first week
Gradually scale to full 30 users
Monitor performance metrics closely
