Specification: Simple UTM Link Builder
1. Project Name
Simple UTM Link Builder (Working titles: "UTM-Easy" or "Trackable")

2. Goal
To create a web-based application that simplifies the process of creating and managing UTM links for marketers. The application should be a more user-friendly and affordable alternative to existing complex tools, focusing on the core functionality needed for effective campaign tracking.

3. Core Users
Digital marketers (especially in small and medium-sized businesses or those with limited budgets).

Marketing teams that need a standardized and simple way to generate UTM links.

Users who find existing tools (like utm.io) too complicated or expensive for their needs.

4. Value Proposition
Simplicity: "It's easier with us." Intuitive interface that feels like a "smarter spreadsheet."

Focused: "Exactly what you need." Offers core functionality without unnecessary complexity or costly additional features.

Efficiency: Saves time in campaign setup by predefining elements and offering smart suggestions.

Accessibility: A web-based solution that is easy to adopt.

5. Core Functionality (MVP - Minimum Viable Product)
5.1. User Authentication and Setup
Simple user registration and login (email/password).

Setup on first use (or via settings):

Define Categories: The user can define their own categories to organize campaigns (e.g., "Electricity," "Mobile Subscription," "App Marketing," "Spring Campaign"). These are stored per user/team.

Define Standard Sources: The user can enter a list of frequently used sources (e.g., google, facebook, linkedin, newsletter). These can be selected from a dropdown list later.

Define Standard Mediums: The user can enter a list of frequently used mediums (e.g., cpc, social, display, email, banner). These can be selected from a dropdown list later.

(Optional MVP) Define Standard Ad Platforms/Channels: Predefine ad platforms that can be linked to sources to provide better suggestions for utm_content.

5.2. Campaign Configuration and Link Generation
A central screen/section for building UTM links:

Target URL: Mandatory field for the webpage the link should point to.

Campaign Name (utm_campaign):

The user can enter a new campaign name.

The user can select from a list of existing campaign names (autocomplete based on previously used names for the user/team).

Campaign Source (utm_source):

Selected from a dropdown list based on the user's predefined sources.

Option to add a new source directly.

Campaign Medium (utm_medium):

Selected from a dropdown list based on the user's predefined mediums.

Option to add a new medium directly.

Campaign Content (utm_content):

Free text field.

Smart suggestions (MVP+): If the user has selected a source/medium combination (e.g., Source: google, Medium: display), the system can suggest common utm_content values (e.g., "300x250_banner", "728x90_leaderboard"). This can be a simple list initially.

Dynamic generation of multiple utm_content variants:

A button to "duplicate" a line for utm_content so the user can quickly create multiple links for the same campaign/source/medium, but with different content (e.g., for A/B testing ad copy or different ad sizes). Each such variant generates its own unique UTM link.

Campaign Term (utm_term) (Optional):

Free text field for paid keywords.

Category (Optional):

Selected from the user's predefined categories to organize the link/campaign internally.

Generate Link(s): A button that generates the full UTM link(s) based on the input.

5.3. Link Management (Simple)
List of Generated Links:

Displays the recently generated links.

For each link, displays: Target URL, Full UTM Link, Campaign Name, Source, Medium, Content, Term, Category, Date Created.

Copy Button: Simple copying of the full UTM link to the clipboard.

Storage: Links are stored in Firestore associated with the user's account.

No advanced filtering, sorting, or grouping in MVP. Focus is on generation and easy access to recent links.

5.4. URL Shortener (Consider for MVP or V2)
Integration: Option to connect to an existing URL shortener service (e.g., Bitly API, Cuttly API) or build a very simple internal shortener.

Functionality: After the UTM link is generated, the user can choose to shorten it.

Display: The shortened link is displayed next to the full UTM link.

Note: This can increase complexity. For MVP, generating only the long UTM link may be sufficient.

6. Technology Stack (Suggested for Replit-friendliness)
Frontend: React (Create React App or Vite for quick setup).

Styling: Tailwind CSS for rapid UI development and responsive design.

State Management: React Context API or Zustand for simple global state (e.g., user info, predefined lists).

Backend/Database: Firebase

Authentication: Firebase Authentication (Email/password).

Database: Firestore for storing user data, categories, predefined sources/mediums, and generated UTM links.

Hosting: Replit (for easy deployment and development) or Firebase Hosting.

7. Data Model (Firestore Example)
users collection:

Document ID: userId (from Firebase Auth)

Fields:

email: string

createdAt: timestamp

categories: array of string (e.g., ["Power", "App"])

defaultSources: array of string (e.g., ["google", "facebook"])

defaultMediums: array of string (e.g., ["cpc", "social"])

defaultCampaignNames: array of string (for autocomplete)

utmLinks collection:

Document ID: auto-generated

Fields:

userId: string (reference to users document)

targetUrl: string

utm_campaign: string

utm_source: string

utm_medium: string

utm_content: string

utm_term: string (can be null)

fullUtmLink: string

shortenedLink: string (can be null, if URL shortener is implemented)

category: string (optional, from user's categories)

createdAt: timestamp

8. User Interface (High-Level UI/UX Thoughts)
Clean and Minimalist Design: Focus on usability. Avoid clutter.

One Main Page for Link Building: Most actions occur in one place to avoid much navigation.

Clear Feedback: The user should see the generated link(s) immediately.

Responsive Design: Works well on both desktop and mobile devices (although desktop is assumed to be primary).

Easy Editing of Settings: Easily accessible page for managing categories, standard sources, and mediums.

9. Future Possibilities (Post-MVP)
More advanced link management (search, filter, edit).

Team functionality (sharing standards and links within a team).

Campaign templates.

Simple reporting or integration with analytics tools (read-access).

CSV export (if demand arises, although it was mentioned as something to avoid initially).

Built-in URL shortener (if not in MVP).

Dynamic QR codes for generated links.

10. Success Criteria for MVP
Users can easily register and set up their preferences.

Users can quickly and intuitively generate one or more UTM links for a campaign.

Generated links are stored and easily accessible for copying.

The application is stable and works reliably.

Positive feedback from a small test group regarding usability and time savings.

This specification should provide a good foundation for starting the development of an MVP. Good luck!
